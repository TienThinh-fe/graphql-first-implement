# graphql-first-implement
This repo is the first attemp using GraphQL and Apollo Server for query books and author data.

## About:
This project is built with tutorial from GraphQL documents, Apollo documents and youtube tutorial:

### GraphQL: https://graphql.org/

### Apollo Server: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/

### Youtube tutorial (Henry Web Dev): https://youtu.be/AEptYkblFg8


## To start:
Clone the repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/TienThinh-fe/graphql-first-implement.git
```

Install the packages:
```
npm i
```

Start server:
```
npm run start
```

## Note:
On the first try, I used the latest version of GraphQL and Apollo Server and it led to the error when starting the server. Therefore, I downgraded the packages to "apollo-server-express": "^2.19.2" and "graphql": "^15.5.0". Hope it work with your machine.

## HAPPY CODING
